# Math Homework Template/Example
This is one of my homeworks from my intro analysis class at Michigan, Math 451. The [preamble.tex](https://github.com/micdwill/LaTeX-Math-Homework/blob/master/preamble.tex)
contains many custom commands. One of which, \begin{mybox} ... \end{mybox}, leads to a colored box of the user's choice. The specific color of the box can be toggled 
by changing the RNG in the preamble. Additionally, there is a custom command for an environment rating the difficulty of proof called \begin{rating} 
followed by \rating{number} \end{rating}.
## Example
This specific homework is based on Riemann integration, step functions, and limits of functions.
